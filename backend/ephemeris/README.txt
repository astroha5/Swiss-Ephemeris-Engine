EPHEMERIS FILES NOTICE
=====================

This directory should contain Swiss Ephemeris files (.se1 format) for accurate
astronomical calculations. 

For production use, please download the complete ephemeris files from:
- https://www.astro.com/swisseph/
- https://github.com/aloistr/swisseph

Required files for comprehensive coverage (1800-2200 CE):
- sepl_*.se1 (planets)
- semo_*.se1 (moon)  
- seas_*.se1 (asteroids)

The current setup may work with built-in approximations but may have reduced
accuracy for dates outside the immediate range.
